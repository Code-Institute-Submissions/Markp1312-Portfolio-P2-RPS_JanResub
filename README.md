# Rock - Paper - Scissors

# Introduction
Project milestone 2 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: JavaScript Essentials.

Rock/paper/scissors is a game that is played between a **player** and the **computer**.


The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. In this game the opponent is simulated by the computer

## User Experience - UX

 ### User Stories

* As a visitor, I want to:
  
1. Play a simple game of Rock/Paper/Scissors against the computer.
2. The UI needs to be intuitive and self explanatory.
3. I want to see the scores.
4. There needs to be a 50/50 chance of winning
5. There needs to be clear messaging when a game is won.
6. There needs to be clear messaging when a game is a draw.
7. There needs to be clear messaging when a game is lost. 
   
   
## Design

### Wireframe
<br>

[Live Wireframe](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/f7175424-323e-400a-bd68-ebd82d3c0952/edit?invitationId=inv_623467ed-9a79-41bf-a5d6-0ae3cbe96994)

### Website Structure
The website has been created as a one page game.
The player score can be seen on the left and the computer score on the right
The options that the player can choose are centralised in the middle of the page and the outcome of each game will be clearly displayed after each round played.


#### Colour Scheme
The main colour for this project is Beige.
Beige is easy on the eye and gives the bright buttons a nice contrast.
For the buttons I have chosen:

Rock : Green
Paper : Red
Scissors : Yellow

 #### Typography
* Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif are being used for the fonts on the Webpage.
      
#### Imagery
* 3 images were used.
   - Rock
   - Paper
   - Scissors

## Features

### Home Page 

![Home Page](./assets/images/Readme/../../Readme/Homepage.jpg)

* When the user enters the webpage there will be a intuitive interface that invites to start playing straight away.
A main goal of the webpage is that the UI is self-explanatory and this has been achieved.

## Future Features
  
### Reset game option.

* I am planning to add a feature to reset the game and players can start over again. At the moment this can only be done by refreshing the page.

### View past choices

* I am planning to implement a table that will keep track of all the choices made by the player or the computer.
This will give a overview of the choices made by either player over the course of the game.


## How To Play

The Player will get the first turn.
When selecting either Rock / Paper or Scissors the computer makes a random selection and the winner will be decided against the game logic.

#### How to Start 

Click any of the 3 buttons (Rock, Paper or Scissors will trigger the game)

#### The Game

 A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.
